description: Sets up and tunes linting and formatting for Node/TypeScript projects - Biome as the one-tool option or ESLint flat config plus Prettier, rule tuning, eslintrc-to-flat and ESLint-to-Biome migrations, editor and CI wiring. Use when the user asks to set up or fix linting, formatting, ESLint, Biome, or Prettier. Not for Next.js apps, type checking, or test setup.

# node-lint

Sets up lint + format so they catch real defects instead of fighting each other.
The failures this skill fixes: models write legacy `.eslintrc` configs that current
ESLint majors no longer load, mix two formatters, claim Biome replaces type
checking, and reset intentional rule customizations during migrations.

## When NOT to use

- Next.js apps → `nextjs-quality` owns `eslint-config-next` and RSC rules.
- Type checking / tsconfig → `node-typescript` (Biome's type-aware rules are not
  a `tsc` replacement — never claim otherwise).
- Test setup → `node-testing`; CI workflow authoring → `node-ci`.

## Workflow

1. **Detect before choosing.** Package manager (lockfile), existing configs
   (`.eslintrc*`, `eslint.config.*`, `biome.json*`, `.prettierrc*`), framework,
   and plugin needs (a11y, imports, framework-specific). Plugin needs decide the
   tool: read the decision table in `references/lint-playbook.md`.
   - **Biome** — one tool for lint+format, fastest path for TS libraries/apps
     without exotic plugin needs.
   - **ESLint (flat config only — modern majors do not load eslintrc) +
     Prettier** — when the plugin ecosystem is required.
   - Never two formatters; never ESLint stylistic rules alongside a formatter.
2. **Write the explicit config** from the playbook's starter blocks — full config,
   no reliance on version-varying defaults. Wire `package.json` scripts
   (`lint`, `format`, `lint:fix`) with `--max-warnings=0` for CI use.
3. **Migrations** (when an old setup exists): follow the playbook's path —
   official flat-config migrator or `biome migrate eslint`. Diff the effective
   rule set; preserve intentional customizations; run on the whole codebase and
   triage new findings before deleting the old config.
4. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_lint_setup.py"
   ```
   plus a clean run of the chosen tool over the repo (`npx biome check .` or
   `npx eslint . --max-warnings=0`).
5. **Report** the tool choice rationale, rules deliberately disabled, and where
   CI should call the scripts (route the workflow wiring to `node-ci`).

## Output spec

One linter + one formatter, explicit committed config, scripts wired, zero
errors/warnings on the current codebase (or a documented triage list), no
leftover legacy config files, editor settings noted.

## Gotchas

- Flat config resolves relative to each linted file's directory in current
  ESLint majors — monorepo packages can carry their own config layers.
- `biome migrate eslint` maps what it can; rules without Biome equivalents are
  dropped silently — always diff and list them.
- Version-gate everything: tool majors move fast; the playbook marks claims that
  must be re-verified against official docs at use time.
- A lint pass that only silences rules is a failure — tune by fixing signal.

## Files

- `references/lint-playbook.md` — decision table, explicit starter configs,
  migration paths, tuning discipline.
- `scripts/check_lint_setup.py` — deterministic sanity checks (single formatter,
  no legacy+flat config coexistence, scripts wired); non-zero exit on violations.
