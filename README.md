Agent Skills for maintaining high-quality open-source Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js, and React apps and packages - linting, type safety, testing, packaging and releases, and CI quality gates.

Agent Skills for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) (and any
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible tool). Each skill is a folder under
[`skills/`](skills/) with a single-purpose `SKILL.md`, trigger evals, and optional
scripts/references — validated on every write, commit, and PR.

## Quick start

Install with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) — auto-detects 70+ agents
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, pi, …):

```bash
npx skills add Paldom/node-skills                  # all detected agents
npx skills add Paldom/node-skills -a codex -a pi   # or target specific agents
```

Or with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_skill_install) (≥ 2.90),
including version-pinned installs from releases:

```bash
gh skill install Paldom/node-skills
gh skill install Paldom/node-skills <skill> --pin <tag>
```

Or as a Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add Paldom/node-skills
/plugin install node-skills@node-skills
```

Or copy a single skill into a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paldom/node-skills.git
cp -r node-skills/skills/<skill-name> your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Then just describe the task — the skill activates on its description — or invoke it
explicitly with `/<skill-name>`.

## Repository structure

```
skills/                  # distributed skills, one folder per skill (SKILL.md + evals/ + scripts/)
docs/                    # skill-authoring guide, eval methodology, deployment guide
scripts/                 # deterministic validator used by hooks and CI
skills.sh.json           # skills.sh repo-page customization (groupings)
.claude/                 # agentic dev setup: hooks + bundled add-skill / publish-repo skills
.claude-plugin/          # plugin + marketplace manifests (makes this repo installable)
.local/                  # gitignored working area: sources, research, PROMPT.md (see below)
```

## Working on this repo with an agent

This repo is agent-native: canonical agent instructions live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (CLAUDE.md imports it), hooks validate every `SKILL.md` on
write, `make check` runs the full validator, and CI enforces the same gate on every
PR. The bundled `add-skill` skill walks the eval-first authoring workflow described
in [docs/skill-authoring.md](docs/skill-authoring.md). Maintainers drive sessions
with their own (gitignored, personal) `.local/PROMPT.md` goal prompt.
